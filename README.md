# cp-frontier

The goal of this project is to create a competitive programming app better than the top existing website, solving problems like the boring reading and writing in stdin and astdout, using main functions unique for any submission, that calls for every test case a function called "Solve", passing the minimum required arguments in a standard way between languages and return the result. The input is read from a file, that the user can download to run the program locally, and solution is written in stdout.
The score is a weighted mean from the time and memory used, and the type ofprogramming language used, otherwise a language like python in most case will be the worst.

The protocol used for API is GRPC.
